Cracking the Coding Interview + Video made by Author

Be Experienced
- Experience means Rate at you observe key lessons from things + usefulness of these lessons.
- Proactively look for patterns, write it down.
- Practice as realistically as possible.
- Do a lot of interviews + Mock Interviews.
You know what you’re doing
- Rely on habits, rules and system.
- Ex: When interviewer ended explaining the question, what things you should do?
    - Description of the problem
    - Sample Input and output
    - Constraints
    - Whiteboard/shared screen

- Create a drawing in your head
- Ask few questions:
    - Why it is hard to code
    - What assumption can I make to make this problem easier
    - What is my big o runtime
    - Whats next best big o
    - Why is this possible?
    - Is it not possible?
    - Where the repeated work happening?
    - Does this need to happen?
Explain your solution to your interviewer:
- Explain solution in plain English
- Step by step (bullets)
- Pseudocode
- Functions
- Implement

Be Smart
- Creativity (Asking questions, Making relevant assumptions of problem space)
- Self Awareness (When you’re going down to wrong path and correcting it)
- Consistency (Do everyday)
- Intensity (Label of mental Engagement)
